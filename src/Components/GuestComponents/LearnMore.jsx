            Our mission is to democratize access to career-building experiences

            internships that match their skills and ambitions. For companies,
            we strive to simplify the process of finding eager, capable talent
            who can add value from day one.

            What We Offer
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-justify text-gray-700">
            InternSpark provides a focused platform for discovering internship
            opportunities, tracking application progress, and learning from real
            workplace experiences. Our platform emphasizes clarity — concise
            role descriptions, clear application statuses, and tools that help
            students showcase their strengths.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-justify text-gray-700">
            For companies, we offer streamlined posting and candidate
            management features that reduce administrative overhead while
            improving candidate quality. Recruiters can present well-structured
            opportunities that attract motivated students and create long-term
            pipelines for future hiring.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold text-oxfordblue">For Students</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-justify text-gray-700">
            Students on InternSpark will find opportunities that align with
            their learning goals and timelines. Our approach values small wins —
            short-term projects, mentorship opportunities, and clear learning
            outcomes. We encourage reflection and portfolio-building so each
            internship becomes a stepping stone, not just a line on a CV.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-justify text-gray-700">
            We also emphasize soft-skill development: communication, teamwork,
            and problem-solving are highlighted in role descriptions so students
            understand what they will practice and improve during their
            placements.

          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-justify text-gray-700">
            Companies using InternSpark gain access to engaged students ready to
            contribute. Our tools are built to help hiring teams present clear
            expectations and measure impact. Structured role templates and
            progress tracking allow companies to run internships that are both
            productive and educational.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-justify text-gray-700">
            We encourage companies to design roles with mentorship and feedback
            loops in mind — this increases intern learning and improves the
            likelihood of long-term collaboration.

          <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold text-oxfordblue">How It Works</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-justify text-gray-700">
            InternSpark follows a simple flow: roles are posted with clear
            objectives, students review and apply, and companies manage
            applicants through an intuitive dashboard. Communication is kept
            within the platform to ensure clarity and a searchable history of
            feedback and decisions.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-justify text-gray-700">
            The platform is intentionally lightweight — we focus on the core
            activities that produce learning and contribution. Optional fields
            and templates help both sides save time without sacrificing
            quality.

          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-justify text-gray-700">
            The goal of every placement is measurable learning and meaningful
            work. Students gain real-world experience, mentors refine their
            leadership skills, and companies benefit from fresh perspectives on
            problems. Over time, these small interactions compound into stronger
            career paths and more resilient talent pipelines.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-justify text-gray-700">
            We measure success by the stories of growth: a student's first
            shipped feature, a team's improved productivity, or a lasting mentor
            relationship that leads to future collaboration.
